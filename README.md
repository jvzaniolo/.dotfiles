# JoÃ£o Vitor's .dotfiles

This is my personal .dotfiles manager, feel free to use it as a starting point.

## How to use

First, [create a personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

**And if your are on Linux bash shell, change it to `zsh`**

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Then, clone this repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jvzaniolo/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

When asked for your github password, **paste the generated personal token**

And wait for everything to finish ðŸŽ†
